system design for BMI calculation

Problem analysis:

Input
Weight: data type double
Height :data type double
response:data type string
Processing
Calculate BMI as:
BMI = weight/(height *height )
Check condition 

Output 
BMI category 


Pseudo code 

1. Start the program.
2. Initialize a loop to allow multiple entries.
3. Prompt the user to enter their weight in kilograms.
4. Prompt the user to enter their height in meters.
5. Calculate the BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight / (heigh*height)
6. Check the BMI in which category.
6.1 if it's greater than 25
6.2. Greater than 18.5 and less than 25
6.3 . If less than 18.5 
7. Display the calculated BMI category 
7.1. If Calculated BMI greater than 25 display overweight 
7.2. If calculated BMI is greater than 18.5 and less than 25 display normal weight 
7.3.if calculated BMI less than 18.5 display underweight 

8. Ask the user if they want to calculate BMI for another person (yes/no).
9. If the user answers "yes," repeat from step 3. If "no," terminate the program.
10. End the program.
