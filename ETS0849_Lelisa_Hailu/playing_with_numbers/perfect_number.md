Algorithm Design for perfect number or not

Input
number

Output
perfect number ro not

Operation
intialize perfect to 0 and i to 0

Pseudo Code
1.Start the program.
2.Take input and store it on num(int), intialize perfect to 0 with int data type.
3.intialize i to 1 with int data type
4.if i < num: 4.1 if num % i equals to 0 4.1.1 increase perfect by i 4.2 go to step 4
5.if perfect == num go to step 5.1 else go to step 5.2 5.1 6.print perfect number 5.2 print not perfect number
7.stop the program
