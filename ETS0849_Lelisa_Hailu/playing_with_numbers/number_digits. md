algorithm Design for counting number of digit


Input
number
Output
count number of digit
Operation
Iteration: for loop
Intialization: counter -> 0 int data type
Pseudo Code
1.Start the program.
2.Initialize counter to 0 and declare original_number with 3.data type int.
4.Take input and store it on original_number
if original_number different from 0 go to step 4.1 else go to step 5
 4.1 divide original number by 10 and put it in original number
 4.2 increment counter by 1 
4.3 go to step 4
5.print the counter
6.stop the program
