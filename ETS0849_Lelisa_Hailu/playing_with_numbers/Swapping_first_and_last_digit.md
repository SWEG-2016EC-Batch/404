swap number

Operation
data casting: string to integers and integers to string


Pseudo Code

2.Take input and store it on number(int)
3.cast number to string new_numand put in new intialized new_num(string)
4.intialize char temp to the first character of new_num
change the first character of new_num to the last character to the last num.
5.change the last character to the temp
