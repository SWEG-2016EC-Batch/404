## **QUESTION**
write a program that checks if a number is perfect. Note that a perfect number is an integer where the sum of its divisors minus the number itself
equals the number.
## **PROBLEM ANALYSIS**
#### **Input**:-
1. An integer number
#### **Output**:-
1. Validation statement that confirms whether a number is perfect or not.
#### **Operation**:-
1. do the computation as follows, add up the divisors of the number and subtract the number from the summation.
2. if the result equals with the number itself print perfect else print not perfect
## **PSEUDOCODE**
1. start the program
2. read number
3. compute perfect as add up the divisors of the number and subtract the number from the summation.
4.  if the variable perfect equals with the number itself print "perfect" else print "not perfect".
5.  stop the program
