# System Design for count number of digit

## Input
1. **number**

## Output
1. **count number of digi**

## Operation
1. **Iteration**: for loop
2. **Intialization**: counter -> 0  int data type  
                      


## Pseudo Code
1. Start the program.
2. Initialize counter to 0 and declare original_number with data type int.
3. Take input and store it on original_number
4. if original_number different from 0 go to step 4.1 else go to step 5
    4.1 divide original number by 10 and put it in original number
    4.2 increment counter by 1
    4.3 go to step 4
5. print the  counter
6. stop the program
